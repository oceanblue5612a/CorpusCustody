corpuscustody is a training-data license and provenance gate. It walks a dataset
manifest, resolves the license of every record against an offline SPDX table,
and decides whether the combined set is usable for a declared purpose: internal
research, a commercial product, or redistribution. It flags incompatible
combinations, such as a share-alike corpus mixed into a commercial release, and
it refuses to emit a cleared manifest when any record's provenance is unknown
rather than assuming permissive.

Python 3.11, standard library only. No third-party dependencies and no network
access anywhere in the code.

## The mixing problem

A training set is rarely one license. It is a pile of records pulled from many
places: a permissive tokenizer here, a Wikipedia dump there, a scraped folder
nobody labelled, one corpus grabbed under a non-commercial term and never
flagged. Each record on its own is fine. The set is the problem.

The moment records are combined and put to a purpose, the obligations stack. A
single share-alike record can force the whole release to carry share-alike
terms. A single non-commercial record makes the set unsafe to sell. A single
unlabelled record means you cannot honestly say what you are allowed to do with
any of it. These conflicts are invisible in a per-record spreadsheet, because the
danger lives in the combination and the declared use, not in any one row.

corpuscustody makes that combination explicit. You declare what you intend to do
with the set. It resolves every record, applies the rules a careful reviewer
would apply, and either clears the set for that purpose or refuses and names the
records that blocked it, and why.

## Install

Install as an editable package:

```
pip install -e .
```

Or run without installing, from the project root:

```
set PYTHONPATH=src
python -m corpuscustody version
```

```
corpuscustody 0.1.0
```

The `set PYTHONPATH=src` form is the Windows shell. On a POSIX shell use
`PYTHONPATH=src python -m corpuscustody version`.

## Commands

Four subcommands. All read a manifest; `gate` and `report` also require a
declared `--purpose`.

| Command   | Purpose                                            | Requires `--purpose` |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `resolve` | parse a manifest, print each record's license      | no                   |
| `gate`    | run the pass or refuse decision for a purpose      | yes                  |
| `report`  | combined resolve view then gate view               | yes                  |
| `version` | print the version                                  | no                   |

Run with no subcommand and it prints help and exits 2:

```
python -m corpuscustody
```

```
usage: corpuscustody [-h] {resolve,gate,report,version} ...

Training-data license and provenance gate.

positional arguments:
  {resolve,gate,report,version}
    resolve             parse a manifest and resolve each record's license
    gate                run the pass or refuse decision for a declared purpose
    report              print the combined resolve and gate report
    version             print the version

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

`--purpose` accepts exactly `internal`, `commercial`, or `redistribute`. It is
case-insensitive: `Commercial` normalises to `commercial`. Pass `--out PATH` to
`gate` to write a cleared manifest on PASS.

## The obligation model

Every license in the offline table maps to a set of obligations. An obligation
is a mechanical yes or no fact about the license, not a judgement. These five
obligations are the entire vocabulary the tool reasons over.

| Obligation       | Key              | What it means                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attribution      | `attribution`    | attribution or notices must be preserved                       |
| Share alike      | `share_alike`    | derivatives or the combined work must carry the same license   |
| Non commercial   | `non_commercial` | commercial use is not permitted                                |
| No derivatives   | `no_derivatives` | modified or derived works are not permitted                    |
| Unknown          | `unknown`        | provenance or license is not established                       |

The `unknown` obligation is special. It is never inferred as permissive. A
record whose license cannot be resolved is treated as carrying every restrictive
obligation at once, so it can never quietly pass a gate. That is defined once, in
`src/corpuscustody/spdx.py`, as the `UNKNOWN` sentinel with all five flags set.

## Purposes and why they differ

The same set can be safe for one use and unsafe for another. The purpose you
declare changes which obligations block and which are only noted.

| Purpose        | Intent                                                        | Distribution      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `internal`     | internal research use, not distributed outside the org        | none              |
| `commercial`   | a commercial product, distributed, possibly proprietary       | yes, and for sale |
| `redistribute` | redistributed as a dataset or corpus to third parties         | yes               |

Internal use is the most permissive purpose here, because nothing leaves the
organisation. Share-alike and non-commercial obligations do not block internal
research: you are not distributing, and you are not selling. Commercial use is
the strictest, because it both distributes and sells. Redistribution sits
between the two: it distributes, so no-derivatives blocks it, but it is assumed
non-commercial, so a share-alike record is a note rather than a hard block.

## The compatibility rules

These are the actual rules the code applies, transcribed from the `_RULES` table
in `src/corpuscustody/compat.py`. A blank cell means the obligation raises no
issue for that purpose. `finding` blocks the gate. `note` is informational and
does not block.

| Obligation       | `internal` | `commercial` | `redistribute` |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `unknown`        | finding    | finding      | finding        |
| `share_alike`    | (none)     | finding      | note           |
| `non_commercial` | (none)     | finding      | (none)         |
| `no_derivatives` | note       | finding      | finding        |
| `attribution`    | note       | note         | note           |

Reading the table as prose, so the intent is unambiguous:

- `unknown` is a finding for every purpose. Unknown provenance never passes.
- `share_alike` is a finding for commercial, because a share-alike corpus mixed
  into a proprietary release forces that release to share alike. For
  redistribute it is a note: the combined set must then carry the terms.
- `non_commercial` is a finding for commercial only. Internal and redistribute
  are assumed non-commercial here, so it is not reported at all for internal and
  raises nothing for redistribute.
- `no_derivatives` is a finding for commercial and redistribute, because both
  typically transform or repackage the data, and a note for internal.
- `attribution` is never a blocking finding. It is always a note: attribution
  must be preserved.

Issues are emitted in record order, then in the obligation order declared in
`spdx.py` (`attribution`, `share_alike`, `non_commercial`, `no_derivatives`,
`unknown`), so identical input yields byte-identical output.

## Unknown provenance is a refusal, not a warning
