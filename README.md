corpuscustody is a training-data license and provenance gate. It walks a dataset
manifest, resolves the license of every record against an offline SPDX table,
and decides whether the combined set is usable for a declared purpose: internal
research, a commercial product, or redistribution. It flags incompatible
combinations, such as a share-alike corpus mixed into a commercial release, and
it refuses to emit a cleared manifest when any record's provenance is unknown
rather than assuming permissive.

Python 3.11, standard library only. No third-party dependencies and no network
access anywhere in the code.

## The mixing problem

A training set is rarely one license. It is a pile of records pulled from many
places: a permissive tokenizer here, a Wikipedia dump there, a scraped folder
nobody labelled, one corpus grabbed under a non-commercial term and never
flagged. Each record on its own is fine. The set is the problem.

The moment records are combined and put to a purpose, the obligations stack. A
single share-alike record can force the whole release to carry share-alike
terms. A single non-commercial record makes the set unsafe to sell. A single
unlabelled record means you cannot honestly say what you are allowed to do with
any of it. These conflicts are invisible in a per-record spreadsheet, because the
danger lives in the combination and the declared use, not in any one row.

corpuscustody makes that combination explicit. You declare what you intend to do
with the set. It resolves every record, applies the rules a careful reviewer
would apply, and either clears the set for that purpose or refuses and names the
records that blocked it, and why.

## Install

Install as an editable package:

```
pip install -e .
```

Or run without installing, from the project root:

```
set PYTHONPATH=src
python -m corpuscustody version
```

```
corpuscustody 0.1.0
```

The `set PYTHONPATH=src` form is the Windows shell. On a POSIX shell use
`PYTHONPATH=src python -m corpuscustody version`.

## Commands

Four subcommands. All read a manifest; `gate` and `report` also require a
declared `--purpose`.

| Command   | Purpose                                            | Requires `--purpose` |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `resolve` | parse a manifest, print each record's license      | no                   |
| `gate`    | run the pass or refuse decision for a purpose      | yes                  |
| `report`  | combined resolve view then gate view               | yes                  |
| `version` | print the version                                  | no                   |

Run with no subcommand and it prints help and exits 2:

```
python -m corpuscustody
```

```
usage: corpuscustody [-h] {resolve,gate,report,version} ...

Training-data license and provenance gate.

positional arguments:
  {resolve,gate,report,version}
    resolve             parse a manifest and resolve each record's license
    gate                run the pass or refuse decision for a declared purpose
    report              print the combined resolve and gate report
    version             print the version

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```

`--purpose` accepts exactly `internal`, `commercial`, or `redistribute`. It is
case-insensitive: `Commercial` normalises to `commercial`. Pass `--out PATH` to
`gate` to write a cleared manifest on PASS.

## The obligation model

Every license in the offline table maps to a set of obligations. An obligation
is a mechanical yes or no fact about the license, not a judgement. These five
obligations are the entire vocabulary the tool reasons over.

| Obligation       | Key              | What it means                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attribution      | `attribution`    | attribution or notices must be preserved                       |
| Share alike      | `share_alike`    | derivatives or the combined work must carry the same license   |
| Non commercial   | `non_commercial` | commercial use is not permitted                                |
| No derivatives   | `no_derivatives` | modified or derived works are not permitted                    |
| Unknown          | `unknown`        | provenance or license is not established                       |

The `unknown` obligation is special. It is never inferred as permissive. A
record whose license cannot be resolved is treated as carrying every restrictive
obligation at once, so it can never quietly pass a gate. That is defined once, in
`src/corpuscustody/spdx.py`, as the `UNKNOWN` sentinel with all five flags set.

## Purposes and why they differ

The same set can be safe for one use and unsafe for another. The purpose you
declare changes which obligations block and which are only noted.

| Purpose        | Intent                                                        | Distribution      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `internal`     | internal research use, not distributed outside the org        | none              |
| `commercial`   | a commercial product, distributed, possibly proprietary       | yes, and for sale |
| `redistribute` | redistributed as a dataset or corpus to third parties         | yes               |

Internal use is the most permissive purpose here, because nothing leaves the
organisation. Share-alike and non-commercial obligations do not block internal
research: you are not distributing, and you are not selling. Commercial use is
the strictest, because it both distributes and sells. Redistribution sits
between the two: it distributes, so no-derivatives blocks it, but it is assumed
non-commercial, so a share-alike record is a note rather than a hard block.

## The compatibility rules

These are the actual rules the code applies, transcribed from the `_RULES` table
in `src/corpuscustody/compat.py`. A blank cell means the obligation raises no
issue for that purpose. `finding` blocks the gate. `note` is informational and
does not block.

| Obligation       | `internal` | `commercial` | `redistribute` |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `unknown`        | finding    | finding      | finding        |
| `share_alike`    | (none)     | finding      | note           |
| `non_commercial` | (none)     | finding      | (none)         |
| `no_derivatives` | note       | finding      | finding        |
| `attribution`    | note       | note         | note           |

Reading the table as prose, so the intent is unambiguous:

- `unknown` is a finding for every purpose. Unknown provenance never passes.
- `share_alike` is a finding for commercial, because a share-alike corpus mixed
  into a proprietary release forces that release to share alike. For
  redistribute it is a note: the combined set must then carry the terms.
- `non_commercial` is a finding for commercial only. Internal and redistribute
  are assumed non-commercial here, so it is not reported at all for internal and
  raises nothing for redistribute.
- `no_derivatives` is a finding for commercial and redistribute, because both
  typically transform or repackage the data, and a note for internal.
- `attribution` is never a blocking finding. It is always a note: attribution
  must be preserved.

Issues are emitted in record order, then in the obligation order declared in
`spdx.py` (`attribution`, `share_alike`, `non_commercial`, `no_derivatives`,
`unknown`), so identical input yields byte-identical output.

## Unknown provenance is a refusal, not a warning

The single most consequential design choice is that an unresolvable license does
not degrade to permissive and does not become a soft warning. It becomes a
blocking finding for every purpose, and it makes the gate refuse.

Two things resolve to `UNKNOWN`: an empty license field, and the explicit token
`UNKNOWN`. The resolver in `spdx.py` returns the `UNKNOWN` sentinel for both, and
for any identifier not in the table. That sentinel carries all five obligations,
so it trips the `unknown` finding no matter the purpose.

This default matters because the opposite choice fails silently and expensively.
If unknown resolved to permissive, a scraped folder nobody labelled would sail
through and land in a shipped product, and the first sign of trouble would be a
takedown or a lawsuit. A refusal is loud and cheap: it stops the pipeline now,
names the records, and asks a person to establish provenance before proceeding.
That conservatism is deliberate and not adjustable by a flag.

## A worked gate run

Below are the real decisions for each of the three sample manifests, captured by
running the CLI in this repository. The manifests are described in
[samples/README.md](samples/README.md); they are hand-authored test vectors, not
scraped data.

### permissive.manifest, commercial: PASS, 0 findings

Five permissive records, attribution at most. It clears for commercial with four
attribution notes and no findings.

```
python -m corpuscustody gate samples/permissive.manifest --purpose commercial
```

```
purpose: commercial
records: 5
decision: PASS
findings: 0
notes: 4
  rec-0001 | MIT | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-0002 | Apache-2.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-0004 | BSD-3-Clause | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-0005 | CC-BY-4.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
```

Note that `rec-0003` (CC0-1.0) produces no note at all: CC0 carries no
obligations, so it is silent.

### sharealike.manifest, commercial: REFUSE, 3 findings

The same set that is fine internally mixes share-alike and non-commercial
records into a commercial release. Three findings, and the process exits 1.

```
python -m corpuscustody gate samples/sharealike.manifest --purpose commercial
```

```
purpose: commercial
records: 5
decision: REFUSE
findings: 3
  rec-1002 | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | share_alike: share-alike terms attach to the combined set
  rec-1004 | CC-BY-NC-4.0 | non_commercial: non-commercial license, commercial use blocked
  rec-1005 | GPL-3.0-only | share_alike: share-alike terms attach to the combined set
notes: 5
  rec-1001 | MIT | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-1002 | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-1003 | Apache-2.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-1004 | CC-BY-NC-4.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-1005 | GPL-3.0-only | attribution: attribution must be preserved
```

### sharealike.manifest, internal and redistribute: PASS

The exact same records pass for `internal` (share-alike and non-commercial do
not block internal use, leaving the five attribution notes) and for
`redistribute` (a PASS with seven notes, where the two share-alike obligations
become notes rather than the commercial findings above). Only the declared
purpose changed; the records did not.

### unknown.manifest, internal: REFUSE, 2 findings

Two records resolve to `UNKNOWN`, one from an empty license field (`rec-2003`)
and one from the explicit token (`rec-2005`). Even for the most permissive
purpose, the gate refuses.

```
python -m corpuscustody gate samples/unknown.manifest --purpose internal
```

```
purpose: internal
records: 5
decision: REFUSE
findings: 2
  rec-2003 | UNKNOWN | unknown: provenance unknown, cannot clear
  rec-2005 | UNKNOWN | unknown: provenance unknown, cannot clear
notes: 7
  rec-2001 | MIT | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-2002 | CC-BY-4.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-2003 | UNKNOWN | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-2003 | UNKNOWN | no_derivatives: no-derivatives license, transformation blocked
  rec-2004 | Apache-2.0 | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-2005 | UNKNOWN | attribution: attribution must be preserved
  rec-2005 | UNKNOWN | no_derivatives: no-derivatives license, transformation blocked
```

The `UNKNOWN` records also emit `no_derivatives` notes for internal, because the
sentinel carries every obligation and `no_derivatives` is a note under internal.

## Manifest format field by field

A manifest is a UTF-8 text file, one record per line. Blank lines and lines whose
first non-space character is `#` are ignored, so manifests carry comments and
stay diffable. Each record line has exactly three pipe-separated fields.

```
record_id | spdx_id | source
```

| Field       | Position | Required | Meaning                                                              |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `record_id` | 1        | yes      | free text identifier for the record; an empty value is a parse error |
| `spdx_id`   | 2        | no       | SPDX identifier; empty or unrecognised resolves to `UNKNOWN`         |
| `source`    | 3        | no       | free text provenance note; not validated                            |

Surrounding whitespace on each field is stripped. Parsing is deliberately dumb:
`spdx_id` is read but not validated at parse time, so parsing and license policy
stay in separate modules. Validation happens later, at resolve time. A line with
anything other than three fields raises a `ManifestError` and the process exits
2. A real sample manifest, comment lines and all:

```
# permissive.manifest
rec-0001 | MIT | github.com/example/tokenizer
rec-0002 | Apache-2.0 | github.com/example/corpus-tools
rec-0003 | CC0-1.0 | zenodo.org/record/000001
rec-0004 | BSD-3-Clause | github.com/example/textnorm
rec-0005 | CC-BY-4.0 | data.example.org/news-2020
```

## Output format and the cleared manifest

The `resolve` view lists every record with its resolved license and its active
obligations (or `none`), then a license count summary sorted by SPDX identifier.

```
python -m corpuscustody resolve samples/sharealike.manifest
```

```
records: 5
  rec-1001 | MIT | attribution
  rec-1002 | CC-BY-SA-4.0 | attribution,share_alike
  rec-1003 | Apache-2.0 | attribution
  rec-1004 | CC-BY-NC-4.0 | attribution,non_commercial
  rec-1005 | GPL-3.0-only | attribution,share_alike
license counts:
  Apache-2.0: 1
  CC-BY-NC-4.0: 1
  CC-BY-SA-4.0: 1
  GPL-3.0-only: 1
  MIT: 1
```

The `gate` view is fixed and diffable: a `purpose` line, a `records` count, a
`decision` of `PASS` or `REFUSE`, a `findings` count with one line per finding,
then a `notes` count with one line per note. Each issue line is
`record_id | spdx_id | obligation: message`.

On PASS, passing `--out PATH` writes a cleared manifest. It is written with LF
line endings regardless of platform, so identical input produces byte-identical
output. The file lists every checked record, its resolved identifier, and the
purpose it was cleared for, under a three-line comment header.

```
python -m corpuscustody gate samples/permissive.manifest --purpose commercial --out cleared.manifest
```

```
# corpuscustody cleared manifest
# purpose: commercial
# record_id | spdx_id | cleared_for
rec-0001 | MIT | commercial
rec-0002 | Apache-2.0 | commercial
rec-0003 | CC0-1.0 | commercial
rec-0004 | BSD-3-Clause | commercial
rec-0005 | CC-BY-4.0 | commercial
```

No cleared manifest is written on REFUSE, even if `--out` is given.

## Exit codes

The exit code is the machine-readable result. Use it in CI to fail a pipeline
when the gate refuses.

| Code | Meaning                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | clean: gate passed, or an informational command succeeded     |
| 1    | gate refused: at least one blocking finding                   |
| 2    | usage error or bad input: missing manifest, bad line, bad purpose |

These were confirmed in this session: help with no subcommand exits 2, a passing
gate exits 0, a refusing gate exits 1, and `resolve` on a missing file exits 2
with `error: manifest not found:` on stderr. In a CI step, a nonzero exit from
`gate` should fail the job. To diff two runs in git, commit the `resolve` or
cleared-manifest output and let the deterministic ordering make the diff
meaningful.

## Reading the obligation matrix asset

The matrix below is the license-by-obligation grid. A filled cell means the
license carries that obligation. The `n` column is the record count per license
summed across all three sample manifests.

![License by obligation matrix: nine resolved licenses down the left with a per-license record count column, and five obligation columns (attribution, share alike, non commercial, no derivatives, unknown). Filled cells mark obligations. The UNKNOWN row is amber and every obligation cell is filled, showing it blocks every purpose.](docs/assets/obligation-matrix.svg)

The `n` counts come from running `resolve` over the three sample manifests and
summing: MIT 3, Apache-2.0 3, CC-BY-4.0 2, UNKNOWN 2, and BSD-3-Clause, CC0-1.0,
CC-BY-SA-4.0, GPL-3.0-only, CC-BY-NC-4.0 at 1 each, for 15 records. The UNKNOWN
row is amber because it is the row a reader must not miss: every obligation cell
is filled, so it blocks every purpose.

## Limitations, expanded

This is a mechanical obligation check, not legal advice. It matches SPDX
identifiers against a short hand-maintained table and applies fixed rules. It
does not:

- read or interpret full license texts, only identifiers,
- cover every SPDX identifier, only the common ones in
  `src/corpuscustody/spdx.py`,
- model license version differences beyond the identifiers listed,
- handle dual licensing, exceptions, or per-file license expressions,
- decide whether attribution or share-alike terms are actually satisfied
  downstream, only that they attach,
- distinguish jurisdictions, or account for fair use, database rights, or
  contractual terms that sit on top of the license,
- replace review by a person qualified to make licensing decisions.

Treat a PASS as "no mechanical conflict was found in the table," not as a legal
clearance. The obligation rules are deliberately conservative, so unknown
provenance always blocks rather than defaulting to permissive. If the table does
not contain an identifier, that identifier resolves to `UNKNOWN` and blocks; the
correct fix is to add the identifier to `spdx.py` after a person has verified its
obligations, not to loosen the default. Every result is input to a human
decision, never a substitute for one.

## Design decisions

Two choices shape everything else. Each is stated with the alternative rejected
and why.

**An offline table, not a license API.** Obligations live in a small
hand-maintained dict in `spdx.py`. The rejected alternative was to resolve
identifiers over the network against a live service. That was rejected because a
gate that reaches the network is non-deterministic (the same manifest could pass
today and refuse next week), because a network dependency is a supply-chain and
availability risk in the pipeline where you least want surprises, and because
obligations for the common identifiers are stable and few, so a short audited
table is more trustworthy than an opaque remote answer. The cost is real and
acknowledged: the table is incomplete, and any identifier it lacks resolves to
`UNKNOWN` and blocks. That cost is paid on purpose, and it fails safe.

**Refuse on unknown, not warn.** An unresolvable license makes the gate refuse
for every purpose. The rejected alternative was to warn and let the set pass.
That was rejected because a warning is a decision deferred to nobody: it scrolls
past in a log, the pipeline goes green, and the unlabelled record ships. A
refusal forces the decision to a person now, while it is cheap to fix. The
conservatism is not configurable, because a flag to downgrade refusals to
warnings would be the first thing switched on under deadline pressure, which is
precisely when it is most dangerous.

## Verification

Run the test suite from the project root:

```
set PYTHONPATH=src
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite has 29 tests, all passing in this session (`Ran 29 tests in 0.009s`,
timing on an unspecified machine and indicative only). They cover: SPDX
resolution including empty, explicit `UNKNOWN`, and unrecognised identifiers all
mapping to the sentinel; manifest parsing including field-count errors, empty
record ids, comment and blank handling, and preserved empty license fields;
compatibility evaluation including permissive clearing for commercial,
share-alike blocking commercial but clearing internal, and unknown blocking every
purpose; the gate PASS/REFUSE decision and deterministic cleared-manifest lines;
report rendering and license counts; and the CLI end to end, including exit codes
0, 1, and 2 and writing the cleared manifest on pass.

## Roadmap

No dates. In rough priority order:

- widen the SPDX table with more common identifiers, each added only after its
  obligations are verified by a person,
- support license expressions such as `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and `GPL-3.0 WITH`
  exceptions, resolving to the least restrictive satisfiable combination,
- optionally read `SPDX-License-Identifier` tags from a directory tree so a
  manifest can be generated rather than hand-written,
- a machine-readable output mode (JSON) alongside the current line format for
  tools that would rather parse than diff.
